# About me

I am a DPhil Candidate in Sociology at Nuffield College, University of Oxford. Prior to embarking on my doctoral research, I earned my BA in European and Middle Eastern Languages from Oxford, before completing an MSc in Middle East Politics at SOAS and an MSc in Sociology at Oxford.

I am interested in the causes, consequences, and dynamics of protest and conflict. I have published on the advent of mass nationalism in Tunisia, and the dynamics of labour protest in Egypt. Most abstractly, my work is motivated by an interest in how dynamics endogenous to events, be they revolutions, wars, or more limited forms of contention, play a role in the shaping of outcomes.

My dissertation focuses on revolution and conflict in the Middle East and North Africa. For the work on revolution, I use hand-coded datasets of protest during the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, alongside survey, Twitter, and qualitative interview data. Again using survey data, but employing a natural experimental setup, I am also working on a paper investigating the effects of Mosul's fall to ISIS on individual self-identification in Iraq. Other ongoing projects include work on anti-Christian violence in Egypt, student protest in post-revolutionary Egypt, and the role of ritual Friday protests in constraining contentious action in the first year of the Egyptian Revolution.
