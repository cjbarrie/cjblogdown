# About me

I am a political sociologist of protest and conflict in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). My current book project is on the Tunisian Revolution. I have published work work in *Mobilization* and *Nations and Nationalism*. I have ongoing projects on identity after the rise of ISIS in Iraq, post-revolutionary protest in Egypt and Tunisia, and anti-Christian violence in Egypt. Other interests include nationalism, democratization, historical political sociology, and computational social science (particularly GIS). My next book project looks to chart and explain the rise of anti-colonial nationalism across the MENA and sub-Saharan Africa. 

Currently, I am a DPhil Candidate in Sociology at Nuffield College, University of Oxford. From September 2019, I will be Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow in Sociology at Nuffield.
