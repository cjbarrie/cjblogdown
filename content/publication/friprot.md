abstract = "Focal days of protest are common to episodes of revolutionary mobilization and mass uprising. This paper contributes to research on focal points by exploring the significance of Fridays in patterning mass mobilization in Egypt and Tunisia during the Arab Spring and its aftermath. Analysis of event data derived from Arabic-language news media reveals how a focal day of protest can both enable and truncate collective action absent an organized opposition. In Egypt, resource poor activists exploited the focal properties of Fridays to mobilize large crowds who left mosques to engage in transitory protests. By contrast, workers and students mobilized in workplaces and on university campuses during the working week. In Tunisia, there was no focal day of protest due to the coordinating hand of organized labour. This holds out a key implication for the possibilities of mass mobilization in contexts of political disorganization: the \"when\" of protest can powerfully influence the \"who,\" the \"how,\" and the \"where.\""
